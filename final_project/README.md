# Final Project
The purpose of the final project was to make a website that matches up photos from earth porn, and match it up with a quote from
shower thoughts. I decided to have some fun with it and use quotes from nocontext instead to make it more enjoyable. 

## Front End
I used a bootstrap template to build the page, and then editted it to my liking. Jquery was used to handle click events to change data, as well as download and compress the photos after they have been matched up.

## Back End
PHP was used as a backend to handle communications with the server, as well as downloading the data locally from earthporn so that it can be used with html2canvas.
